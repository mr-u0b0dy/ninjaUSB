## Overview

**ninjaUSB** is a project based on the nRF52840 dongle that aims to build Zephyr-based firmware for a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard. This firmware will receive keystrokes from a PC via BLE and send those keystrokes through USB HID, enabling a seamless interaction between the two devices.

### Features

- **BLE HID Keyboard**: Connects to a PC over BLE to receive keystrokes.
- **USB HID Output**: Sends received keystrokes through USB HID interface.
- **Future Expansion**: Plans to develop advanced BadUSB functionalities, enhancing the capabilities of the device.

## Development

This project is currently under devlopment checkout **dev** branch to look at lastest devlopment.
